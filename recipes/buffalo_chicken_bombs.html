    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Buffalo chicken bombs, refrigerated buttermilk biscuits are rolled thin and filled with a Buffalo chicken mixture and mozzarella cheese, baked until golden brown, and topped with melted butter, parsley, and garlic. Serve ranch dressing or blue cheese dressing on the side as a dip.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Buffalo sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 (8-count) can refrigerated buttermilk biscuits</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, combine chicken, Buffalo sauce, and shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>On a clean surface, using a rolling pin, flatten each biscuit to about 1/8-inch thick. Divide the Buffalo mixture equally between each biscuit (about 1/4 cup per biscuit). Place mixture in the center and pinch the edges of the biscuit together to seal the mixture inside. Place sealed biscuits, seam-side down, on an ungreased baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and hot throughout, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir melted salted butter, parsley flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder together in a bowl; brush over biscuits immediately upon removing from the oven.</li>
        <li>Serve with blue cheese or ranch dressing, for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
